# Hours_Launch

Simple iOS Application for users to track their work hours. This started as a hackathon project but I wanted to see it through. (Built Jul 2016)

Things I learned from building this application:

Use folders when adding new files.

Model View ViewModel is usually always better.

Classes should have less responsibilities.
